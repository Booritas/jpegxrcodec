*
* NOTE 2: Grayscale images will be configured with channel mode
* UNIFORM.
*
* NOTE 3: Although lossless can be achieved with channel modes of
* UNIFORM, SEPARATE and INDEPENDENT, this function will set
* the channel mode to SEPARATE for color images.
*
* - set_QP_UNIFORM()
* All the bands/channels are set with the same QP value. If the
* use_dc_only flag it false, then the DC/LP/HP values are identical,
* but encoded distinctly.
*
* NOTE 1: DC/LP/HP_IMAGEPLANE_UNIFORM is set to true so that the QP
* are kept in the plane header.
*
* - set_QP_SEPARATE
* All the bands are set with the same QP value, depending on the
* component. The Y component gets the first quant value, and the
* remaining channels get the other quant value.
*
* NOTE 1: DC/LP/HP_IMAGEPLANE_UNIFORM is set to true so that the QP
* are kept in the plane header.
*
* NOTE 2: This should NOT be applied to grayscale images. Images
* with 1 channel must have channel mode UNIFORM.
*
* - set_QP_INDEPENDENT
* All the bands are set with the same QP value, but each channel gets
* its own QP value.
*
* NOTE 1: DC/LP/HP_IMAGEPLANE_UNIFORM is set to true so that the QP
* are kept in the plane header.
*
* NOTE 2: For single channel images (i.e. grayscale) this actually
* sets the channel mode to UNIFORM. Only the UNIFORM
* channel mode is valid for grayscale.
*
* - set_QP_DISTRIBUTED
* This is the most complex form. Every tile/channel can have its own
* QP set, and that QP set is mapped onto each
* tile/channel/macroblock. The argument to the set_QP_DISTRIBUTED
* function is an array of jxr_time_qp objects, one object per tile in
* the complete image.
*
* NOTE 1: The tile configuration must be set before this function is
* called. If no tile configuration is set, then there is
* exactly 1 tile.
* NOTE 2: set_QP_DISTRIBUTED causes DC/LP/HP_IMAGEPLANE_UNIFORM to be
* false so that the QP values are moved to tile headers.
